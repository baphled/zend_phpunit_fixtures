Zend_PHPUnit_Fixtures

Testing scaffolding for Zend Framework.

Used to help assist in keeping our test cases isolated.

Features
--------
Various types of fixtures (standard, DB based & dynamic).
Aliasing of fixtures, allowing for simple access.
Define a fixture structure by extending the PHPUnit_Fixtures family.
Generate test data on the fly.
DB related fixtures auto clean the DB after each test.
Integration with MySQL workbench to allow for automatic population of development DB structure.

Install notes
-------------
Import files into current Zend Framework projects, must input configuration settings a initially setup development DB, PHPUnitFixtures will deal with creating the tables and inserting the data.

If using MySQL Workbench it is possible to add the link to settings.ini & run PHPUnit_Fixtures_DynamicDB::getSchema('schemaName').

When running the test suites, please not that some DB & MySQL Workbench critical tests will fail if settings are not correctly imputted into settings.ini
